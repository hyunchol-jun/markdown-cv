Re: Full-Time Position - {{ page.position }}
\
\
\
Dear Hiring Manager,
\
\
\
As a passionate web developer, I am excited to apply for the {{ page.position }} position at {{ page.company }}. 
With self-teaching various programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python and a background in Engineering, I have a strong understanding of algorithms and data structures as well as Command Line Tools. 
Combined with the recent web development skills I gained in the bootcamp at BrainStation, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Node.js, I am confident that I have the skills to help {{ page.company }} succeed.
\
\
In my previous position at Oracle Korea, I was fortunate to pursue and achieve OCP(Oracle 10g Certified Professional) and OCJP(Oracle Certified Java SE 6 Programmer), which gave me a solid understanding of RDBMS, as well as Java programming.
\
\
During my study in Electrical Engineering at university, I self-taught Android mobile application development and created an app for students to provide helpful information about the campus, which resulted in more than 10,000 downloads in the Google Play store.
\
\
I also have a background in Aircraft maintenance working on passenger airplanes. 
I learned how to work on an isolated part of a vast system so that many people can work together and inspect and troubleshoot problems. 
The skills I gained can be transferred into software engineering and will help me in this position.
\
\
I am flexible and willing to take on other positions that may better fit my qualifications.
Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. 
\
\
\
Sincerely, 
\
Hyunchol Jun
